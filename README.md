Assignment of week 11 database
1) The difficulty I faced was in importing CSV files into MySQL workbench whereby I got an error: Unhandled exception: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x81 in position 256: character maps to <undefined>. It took me almost 1 hour to try to solve it by watching various videos on YouTube until I decided to take another set of data with one click I solved it and I was able to import a CSV file.
2) One interesting thing about the database I chose which is Dataset 2: Netflix Shows is all the data is sorted according to the original dataset file without any changes in variables in any table.
